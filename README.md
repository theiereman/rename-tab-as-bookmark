Here are the steps to install it manually :

2. Unzip the content into a folder (name of the folder is irrelevant)
3. In Chrome / Edge go to the extensions page (chrome://extensions or edge://extensions).
4. Enable `Developer Mode` (necessary to sideload Extensions that are not listed on the Chrome Web Store)
5. Drag the folder you extracted at step 2 onto the page to import the extension.
